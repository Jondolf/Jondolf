# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joona, a university student and science enthusiast who has been developing open source software as a hobby since early 2018. In my spare time I like to develop projects that allow me to dive deeper into the areas I'm interested in, and I'm always looking to try out new things.

Currently, I am maintaining and developing [Avian](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian), a physics engine for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/), with a focus on modularity, ergonomics, and providing a native ECS-driven user experience. The Bevy ecosystem is in need of a native ECS-based physics engine, and my goal is to help reach that milestone. This project is my primary focus in terms of software development.

I have also built [Algorust](https://github.com/Jondolf/Algorust), an algorithm visualization website made almost entirely with Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) frontend framework. Currently it just contains interactive visualizations for various sorting and pathfinding algorithms, but I might return to the project to add more at some point.

I also have a personal website, https://joonaa.dev! There, you can find my blog and projects.
