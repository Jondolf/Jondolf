# Hello there üëã

I am a high school student who loves programming, gaming, and art.

I make programming projects for fun and for learning purposes, and I like trying out different technologies.

## Highlights

Below are a few of my bigger projects.

### [Algorithm website ü§ñ](https://github.com/Jondolf/rust-algorithms) (unreleased, under development)

I am currently developing an interactive algorithm visualization website, made almost entirely with Rust and the [Yew frontend framework](https://yew.rs/). The app is primarily for fun and for learning purposes, but I plan on releasing it when I believe it's ready enough.

The app contains sorting and pathfinding algorithms (as of 21st of April 2022). Developing this is an incredible learning experience, as it covers things like:

- Understanding various algorithms, implementing them and writing their descriptions
- Rust, WebAssembly and working with Rust on the web
- Frontend design
- Drawing on the HTML canvas interactively (from Rust, using web apis through web-sys)
- Audio with web apis (for the visualizations)
- Progressive Web Apps

...and a lot more. In my opinion, this is my most polished and involved project so far.

### Gamitopia üå¥

[Gamitopia](https://gamitopia.herokuapp.com) is a website where I publish my games and apps and make blogs/news posts about the progress and new releases. There you can see some of my projects and a bit off the process of making them.

### Calculator ‚ûó

[Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamitopia.calculator) is a free Android calculator app that I made with Ionic Angular. It includes a basic calculator with a semi-customizable layout, many unit converters (e.g. from centimeters to inches or from Euros to US dollars), a simple chart creation tool and a graphing calculator. It is quite customizable and has many different light and dark themes. It is my first ever mobile app.

## Plans üìù

I plan to keep learning programming technologies and concepts, and making more games, apps and other projects. School is my main priority, so progress may be slow at times due to me being busy or tired.

Currently I'd like to learn more about algorithms and data structures, and about how computers really work under the hood. I want to develop a bigger picture of how computers and softare work, and to understand how and why things do what they do and how different things may impact performance.
