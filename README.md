## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am a junior high school student who loves programming, gaming, and art.  

### Gamitopia ðŸŒ´

I have a website called [Gamitopia](https://gamitopia.herokuapp.com) where I publish my games and apps and make blogs/news posts about the progress and new releases. There you can see some of my projects and a bit off the process that goes into making them.

### What technologies and programming languages I have used ðŸ’»

I mainly use web technologies, mostly Vue.js with HTML, TS and SCSS, but I also like to explore and experiment with very different technologies. I have used Angular with Ionic. I have also used the Unity game engine (with C#) a bit and have created some small test games with it.

### My current projects ðŸ•¹

I'm currently working on a mobile app made with Angular and Ionic. It will be published to Google Play soon. It will be one of my largest projects so far, and I am very excited to release it.  

### How to contact me âœ‰

Currently you can contact me by sending an email to gamitopia@gmail.com
