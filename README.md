# Hello there üëã

I am a high school student who loves programming, gaming, and art.

I make programming projects for fun and for learning purposes, and I like trying out different technologies.

## Highlights

Below are a few of my bigger projects.

### Gamitopia üå¥

[Gamitopia](https://gamitopia.herokuapp.com) is a website where I publish my games and apps and make blogs/news posts about the progress and new releases. There you can see some of my projects and a bit off the process of making them.

### Calculator ‚ûó

[Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamitopia.calculator) is a free Android calculator app that I made with Ionic Angular. It includes a basic calculator with a semi-customizable layout, many unit converters (e.g. from centimeters to inches or from Euros to US dollars), a simple chart creation tool and a graphing calculator. It is quite customizable and has many different light and dark themes. It is my first ever mobile app.

## Plans üìù

I plan to keep learning programming technologies and concepts, and making more games, apps and other projects. School is my main priority, so progress may be slow at times due to me being busy or tired.

Currently I'd like to learn more about algorithms and data structures, and about how computers really work under the hood. I want to develop a bigger picture of how computers and softare work, and to understand how and why things do what they do and how different things may impact performance.
