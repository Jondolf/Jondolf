# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school student interested in various different topics, such as science, technology, web development, art, games, and game development. In my spare time I like to develop projects that allow me to dive deeper into these areas, and I'm always looking to try out new things.

Currently, I'm working on my new personal website https://joonaa.com and developing [bevy_xpbd](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd), a [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) physics engine that uses Extended Position Based Dynamics. On my website, I will share my work and write blog posts about whatever I'm interested in or working on, like the physics engine.

One of my best projects so far is [Algorust](https://github.com/Jondolf/Algorust), an algorithm visualization website made almost entirely with Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) frontend framework. Currently it contains interactive visualizations for various sorting and pathfinding algorithms, and I will return to the project to add more at some point.

I have also developed and published [Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamitopia.calculator), a free Android calculator app that I made with Ionic Angular. It has a basic calculator, a graphing calculator, unit converters, lots of themes, and more, but it certainly isn't perfect, as it is my first ever mobile application.
