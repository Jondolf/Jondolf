# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school student who is interested in various different topics, such as science, technology, web development, art, games, and game development. In my spare time I like to develop projects that allow me to dive deeper into these areas, and I'm always looking to try out new things.

Currently I'm rebuilding my old personal website [Gamitopia](https://gamitopia.herokuapp.com) from scratch (its name might change) and developing [Svelte Math Graph](https://github.com/Jondolf/svelte-math-graph), an experimental component library (and website) for easily making mathematical graphs and visualizations. Recently I have also been really interested in the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org) game engine, and I am developing [bevy_xpbd](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd), a physics engine based on Extended Position Based Dynamics.

One of my best projects so far is [Algorust](https://github.com/Jondolf/Algorust), an algorithm visualization website made almost entirely with Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) frontend framework. Currently it contains interactive visualizations for various sorting and pathfinding algorithms, and I will return to the project to add more at some point.

I have also developed and published [Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamitopia.calculator), a free Android calculator app that I made with Ionic Angular. It has a basic calculator, a graphing calculator, unit converters, lots of themes, and more, but it certainly isn't perfect, as it is my first ever mobile application.
