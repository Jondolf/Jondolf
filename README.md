# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a high school student interested in various different topics, such as science, technology, web development, art, games, and game development. In my spare time I like to develop projects that allow me to dive deeper into these areas, and I'm always looking to try out new things.

Currently I am maintaining and developing [Bevy XPBD](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd), a [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) physics engine that uses *Extended Position Based Dynamics*. The Bevy ecosystem is in need of a native ECS-based physics engine, and my goal is to help reach that milestone.
This project is my primary focus in terms of software development.

I have also built [Algorust](https://github.com/Jondolf/Algorust), an algorithm visualization website made almost entirely with Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) frontend framework. Currently it just contains interactive visualizations for various sorting and pathfinding algorithms, but I might return to the project to add more at some point.

I also have a personal website, https://joonaa.dev! There you can find my blog and projects.
